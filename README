= Colliding Galaxies

This is my _why Day project where I decided to convert the XScreensaver, Galaxy, that comes with many Linux distributions, from C to JavaScript source, animated by HTML5's canvas element.
The canvas and jQuery code was inspired by the kathack.com script by Alex Leone, David Nufer, David Truong.
